                        <p>This is my first drawing, I drew Ayato from Genshin Impact as a congratulatory drawing for his birthday. I was discussing with a friend and had a whim to draw a birthday picture for him, so I started my first re-creation.</p>

                        <p>This is the third picture I drew, the second one I drew for Ayato, still for his birthday. Since the game talks about his life, I depicted him based on the description in the game. My friend said why I drew such a heavy topic on his birthday, but it's actually because I wanted to tell him that growing up isn't easy, and that it must have taken a lot of effort for him to grow up to be the Ayato that he is now, and I wanted to tell him that he's worked hard.</p>

                        <p>This is the fourth picture I drew, which I did at the end of first year. The character is Yuan Ji from the game Dai Haoyuan, and I really like the scene when he and I first met in the game, because it's a love game and he often has a purposeful “chance encounter” with me, so I wanted to create a scene where he's holding an umbrella in a bamboo forest, and with a deliberate and unintentional one. So I wanted to create a scenario where he was holding an umbrella in a bamboo forest, and with a deliberate and unintentional turn of his head, he said to me “Dian Xia, chance encounter”, and it just so happened that bamboo was his representative plant.</p>

                        <p>This is my fifth drawing of Shen He from Genshin Impact, I drew it partly because I think she's pretty, and partly because she's wearing a new dress in the game, and the new dress is really pretty, it's a cheongsam style, but it's a bit revealing and doesn't match her temperament, and the new dress comes out on Chinese New Year, wearing a black cheongsam! It's not a good idea to wear a black cheongsam for Chinese New Year.Shen He's modeling body is very good, but this tends to make many people ignore her cool character and her own, so I drew this picture to tell people not to pay attention to her body only. I didn't realize it when I was drawing it, but after I finished it, I realized that a lot of people would still pay attention to her figure, and that I was highlighting her figure a bit too much. I realized after I drew it that I couldn't change it if I did, so I had to leave it like that.</p>

                        <p>This is my sixth drawing, the character is Guang Lingwang from the game Dai Haoyuan, she is actually my image in the game, I drew her because she doesn't look like a player's image in the game, she looks more like herself, and I'm looking at her point of view as she goes through things. Because the setting of the game is the former China, that time China is still the Eastern Han Dynasty, in the history of the Eastern Han Dynasty is about to fall, the Three Kingdoms period is coming, Gang Lingwang disguise as a man to revive the Han Dynasty, and finally will become the emperor, and the hardships along the way only she and the player know. She has detached herself from the player's in-game image, and it's more like we're watching her revive the Han Dynasty through her perspective. When I'm drawing her, she's maneuvering the board, I'm drawing her, and sometimes it feels like I'm drawing myself.</p>

                        <p>This is the seventh image, featuring Yae Miko from the game Genshin Impact.This is a birthday greeting image I drew for her, inspired by her personal storyline. She's a fox who has practiced for hundreds of years to be able to take human form. But the centuries have left her with fewer and fewer friends, many of whom have passed away. She holds a Night of a Hundred Ghosts for her friends who have passed away by her friends becoming spirits possessing others to talk to her. Upon seeing her friends dissipate, she says, “I really do live every day oh so happily.” She didn't show it, but it was definitely hard and sad. So using that as inspiration, I drew a picture of her praying under a cherry blossom tree.</p>

I drew this picture near the beginning of the school year, so I had to try my best to finish it on his birthday and send it out. zayne is the hardest character I've ever drawn for a boy because he's in 3D, unlike the others which have 2D official images. It took me two days to draw his sketch, and I changed it a lot. But it was a challenge for me, I finished the drawing in only 5 days and I'm very happy with it, I think it's a successful work that pushed my limits.</p>

I was practicing drawing the human body at the time, and I thought it would look great if I drew a human body with his face, so I drew a rough draft and a line drawing. I wanted to continue drawing, but I got too busy after school started and I didn't have time to continue.</p>

It was inspired by the fact that I really want him to have a happy time, and I hope he can have a great time every day, a real one, not a pretend one. That's why I chose to have him holding a firework in his hand, which will make him happy at the sight of it. I haven't finished this picture yet because I don't have time to draw it because I have too much homework, but I will try to finish it after the vacation, because it's kind of the only gift I can give him.</p>

But because of things that happened in their family, the two of them didn't grow up together, and neither of them knew what each other looked like until after they recognized each other. I've always wanted to have a brother, and the appearance of Zhou Yu has kind of fulfilled one of my desires, so the Zhou Yu I drew in this one is looking at Guang Lingwang with doting and helpless eyes, just like a brother looking at his younger sister and pampering her.</p>

She's a bit cold to strangers, but she'll be nicer after she gets familiar with them. This is one of the ooc I'm most satisfied with.</p>
